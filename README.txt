heapfuck is a small language project I wanan do before moving on to making
more "conventionnal" languages and learning to use LLVM. 
It's goal is to be a brainfuck like language where the infinite array is 
replaced by a Binary Heap.
The language will support every bf operation + a few ones related to heaps.
