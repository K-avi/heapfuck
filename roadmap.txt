heapfuck isn't very ambitious ; 

I'll reuse code from (SIASL)Â² and siasl ; 


from siasl2 :  ast.c ; exec.c ; cmdline_interp.c

from siasl : stack.c ; globals.c 


might also add some operators like something to pop a value from the heap
and something to add one to add one

heap manipulation written ; not tested yet though
